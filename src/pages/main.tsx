              Rare diseases are a group of diseases or syndromes that are oftenÂ chronic in nature and usually life-threatening. Majority of these diseases are genetic in nature, hence present by
              childhood.
              <br /> There are no geographically predisposed or endemic regions for rare diseases, hence they present in every country. However, not all rare conditions are of genetic origin. Other
              rare diseases include rare infections (bacterial or viral), rare allergic reactions and rare cancers. <br />
              There is generally a lack of awareness, expertise and research in rare diseases. It is a herculean task to receive a proper diagnosis to persons with rare diseases. Access to medical
              treatment, therapies, services and the appropriate health and social care are lacking in Nepal.
